## Description

The note taker app is a simple web application that allows the user to save and retrieve notes from an external JSON file to display, organize, and keep track of tasks that need to be completed. This application uses the frontend technologies, npm packages that enable file reading/writing, and the Express.js module making it a complete web application that uses client and server side interactions.

## Usage

The note taker app opens up with a landing page with a clicklable link to the notes page. Once clicked, the user is presented with a page containing existing notes on the left-hand column and text fields for a new note entry on the right-hand column. Once a note title and text is entered, a save icon appears at the top right of the page and when it is clicked, the note is saved to the exisiting notes list. If an existing note is clicked, that note reappears in the right-hand column. The "+" icon can be clicked at the top right to clear the note text fields and enter a new note.
